# Introduction
- NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, which are multi-dimensional containers for large data sets.
- NumPy also includes a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

# Installation
- To use this repository, you need to have NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip: "pip install numpy"

# Usage
## Creating Arrays
## Single-Dimensional Arrays
- A single-dimensional array (or vector) is a simple list of elements.

# Multi-Dimensional Arrays
- A multi-dimensional array (or matrix) can be created by nesting lists within lists.

# Indexing and Slicing
## Indexing
- Indexing in NumPy allows you to access individual elements of the array.

## Slicing
- Slicing enables you to access a range of elements in an array.

# Stacking Arrays
- Stacking is the process of joining arrays along different axes.

# Code Available related to : 
## Horizontal Stacking
## Vertical Stacking
## Stacking Along a New Axis
